# Plugins.Essentials  
This repository contains a collection of essential "Web Plugins" that are built to be loaded directly by a `ServiceStack` in your application, and conform to all required constrains for runtime loading. Some library packages my be consumed directly by your library/application to perform included functionality or provide a base class or set of classes to reduce complexity. Please see each package's readme.md file for further information.  

This repo will be used a small "mono-repo" for essential runtime loadable plugins that provide essential web-site/api functionality.  

This repo also now contains the [vnlib.browser](lib/vnlib.browser) TypeScript library, which is a collection of TypeScript classes and functions that are used to provide a consistent and easy to use interface for common web-site functionality.
