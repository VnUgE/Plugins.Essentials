# Plugins.Essentials  
This repository contains a collection of essential "Web Plugins" that are built to be loaded directly by a `ServiceStack` in your application, and conform to all required constrains for runtime loading. Some library packages my be consumed directly by your library/application to perform included functionality or provide a base class or set of classes to reduce complexity. Please see each package's readme.md file for further information.  

This repo will be used a small "mono-repo" for essential runtime loadable plugins that provide essential web-site/api functionality.  

## Builds
